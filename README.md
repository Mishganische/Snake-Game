Terminal Snake is a classic arcade game made in a terminal text interface. Controlling a snake, the player must collect food to extend his body and score points. The longer the snake, the more difficult it is to avoid collisions with your own body and the boundaries of the field. The game develops reaction, attentiveness and coordination. Ideal for lovers of retro style and minimalist interfaces.
